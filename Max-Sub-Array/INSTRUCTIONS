common steps:
1) make sure you are on linux, or cygwin/gitshell under windows and you have GCC instealled.
2) sh prerun.sh

then:

for Metaruntime:
1) ./run 6 3 -2 6 1 -90 17 -4 1 2 2 2 -5 2 -2 3 -3 1 10 -7       //any number of arguments, any int numbers.
2) (optional) for running the generated metaprogram without compiling it again, use: ./meta      //without arguments

for Regular Runtime:
1) ./run
2) ./meta 6 3 -2 6 1 -90 17 -4 1      //1-16 arguments


if you want to benchmark, you can use "time" command before running stuff. 
eg: time ./run 
eg2: time ./meta
